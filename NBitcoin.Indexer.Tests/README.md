# Tests

To run the tests, you need to set your development time [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=windows) by using `dotnet user-secrets set`.

Example:

```
StorageNamespace = qbit
Bitcoin.Network = test
Azure.Key = yourazurestoragekey
Azure.AccountName = yourazurestorageaccount
```
